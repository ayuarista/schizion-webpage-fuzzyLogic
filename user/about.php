People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality. They may hear voices other people don’t hear. They may think other people are trying to hurt them.

          • Hallucinations: when a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels things that are not real. “Hearing voices” is common for people with schizophrenia. People who hear voices may hear them for a long time before family or friends notice a problem.
          Delusions: when a person believes things that are not true. For example, a person may believe 
          that people on the radio and television are talking directly to him or her. Sometimes people believe that they are in danger and others are trying to hurt them.<br> <br>
          • Thought disorders: when a person has ways of thinking that are odd or illogical. People with thought disorders may have trouble organizing their thoughts. Sometimes a person will stop talking in the middle of a thought or make up words that have no meaning.<br> <br>
        • Movement disorders: when a person has may appear as agitated body movements. A person may repeat  certain motions over and over. In the other extreme, a person may stop moving or talking for a while, which is a rare condition called catatonia.

      <br><p style="color:#444;">Scientists have long known that schizophrenia sometimes runs in families. However, there are many people who have schizophrenia who don’t have a family member with the disorder and conversely, many people with one or more family members with the disorder who do not develop it themselves.<br><br>

Scientists believe that many different genes may increase the risk of schizophrenia, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself. It is not yet possible to use genetic information to predict who will develop schizophrenia.<br><br>

Scientists also think that interactions between genes and aspects of the individual’s environment are necessary for schizophrenia to develop. Environmental factors may involve:<br><br>

    • Exposure to viruses<br>
    • Malnutrition before birth<br>
    • Problems during birth<br>
    • Psychosocial factors<br>

</p>
    </div>
    <br><div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
      <br><p style="color:#444">Scientists think that an imbalance in the complex, interrelated chemical reactions of the brain involving the neurotransmitters (substances that brain cells use to communicate with each other) dopamine and glutamate, and possibly others, plays a role in schizophrenia.<br><br>

Some experts also think problems during brain development before birth may lead to faulty connections. The brain also undergoes major changes during puberty, and these changes could trigger psychotic symptoms in people who are vulnerable due to genetics or brain differences.<br>

      <br><p style="color:#444;">Antipsychotic medications help patients with the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Some people have side effects when they start taking medications, but most side effects go away after a few days. <br><br>Side effects include:<br> • Blurry vision <br>• Body movements a person can’t control, such as shaking Dizziness<br>• Drowsiness Fast<br>• Heartbeat<br>• Feeling restless <br>• Menstrual problems<br>• Sensitivity to the sun<br>• Skin rashes<br>• Stiffness in the body<br><br>
             Some types of antipsychotic medications can cause a lot of weight gain and other health concerns, which can lead to diabetes, high cholesterol, or other conditions. Other types of antipsychotic medications can cause side effects related to physical movement where a person cannot control muscle movements, especially around the mouth.People respond to antipsychotic medications differently, so it is important to report any of these side effects to a doctor. Sometimes a person needs to try several medications before finding the right one. People should not stop taking a medication without first talking to a doctor. Stopping medication suddenly can be dangerous, and it can make schizophrenia symptoms worse.

                                • Illness management skills: helps the patient learn about schizophrenia and manage it from day-to-day <br>
                                • Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): helps the patient identify current problems and how to solve them. A CBT therapist focuses on changing unhelpful patterns of thinking and behavior. <br>
                                • Rehabilitation: helps with getting a job or going to school and everyday living skills<br>
                                • Self-help groups: provide support from other people with the illness and their families<br>

They may hear voices other people don’t hear. They may think other people are trying to hurt them. Sometimes they don’t make any sense when they talk. Although schizophrenia is not as common as other mental disorders, the symptoms can be very disabling.</p>

In Indonesia, with various biological, psychological and social factors with a diversity of inhabitants; then the number of cases of mental disorders increase which affects the addition of state burden and decrease in human productivity for the long term. Riset Kesehatan Dasar (Riskesdas) data (2013) shows the prevalence of mental emotional imbalance shown by symptoms of depression and anxiety for the age of 15 years and over to reach about 14 million people or 6% of the total population of Indonesian people. While the prevalence of severe mental disorders, such as schizophrenia reached about 400,000 people or as many as 1.7 per 1,000 population.

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2><br>
      <h5>There are several factors that contribute to the risk of developing schizophrenia.</h5><br>

      <br><p style="color:#444;">Scientists have long known that schizophrenia sometimes runs in families. However, there are many people who have schizophrenia who don’t have a family member with the disorder and conversely, many people with one or more family members with the disorder who do not develop it themselves.<br><br>

Scientists believe that many different genes may increase the risk of schizophrenia, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself. It is not yet possible to use genetic information to predict who will develop schizophrenia.<br><br>

Scientists also think that interactions between genes and aspects of the individual’s environment are necessary for schizophrenia to develop. Environmental factors may involve:<br><br>

    • Exposure to viruses<br>
    • Malnutrition before birth<br>
    • Problems during birth<br>
    • Psychosocial factors<br>

</p>
    </div>
    <br><div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
      <br><p style="color:#444">Scientists think that an imbalance in the complex, interrelated chemical reactions of the brain involving the neurotransmitters (substances that brain cells use to communicate with each other) dopamine and glutamate, and possibly others, plays a role in schizophrenia.<br><br>

Some experts also think problems during brain development before birth may lead to faulty connections. The brain also undergoes major changes during puberty, and these changes could trigger psychotic symptoms in people who are vulnerable due to genetics or brain differences.<br>

      <h2>Treatments and Therapies</h2><br>
      <h5>Because the causes of schizophrenia are still unknown, treatments focus on eliminating the symptoms of the disease. Treatments include:</h5><br><br>
             <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
    <li class="active"><a href="#menu5">Antipsychotics</a></li>

  <div class="tab-content">
    <div id="menu5" class="tab-pane fade in active">
      <br><p style="color:#444;">Antipsychotic medications help patients with the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Some people have side effects when they start taking medications, but most side effects go away after a few days. <br><br>Side effects include:<br> • Blurry vision <br>• Body movements a person can’t control, such as shaking Dizziness<br>• Drowsiness Fast<br>• Heartbeat<br>• Feeling restless <br>• Menstrual problems<br>• Sensitivity to the sun<br>• Skin rashes<br>• Stiffness in the body<br><br>
             Some types of antipsychotic medications can cause a lot of weight gain and other health concerns, which can lead to diabetes, high cholesterol, or other conditions. Other types of antipsychotic medications can cause side effects related to physical movement where a person cannot control muscle movements, especially around the mouth.People respond to antipsychotic medications differently, so it is important to report any of these side effects to a doctor. Sometimes a person needs to try several medications before finding the right one. People should not stop taking a medication without first talking to a doctor. Stopping medication suddenly can be dangerous, and it can make schizophrenia symptoms worse.

    <div id="menu6" class="tab-pane fade">
      <br><p style="color:#444">Psychosocial treatments help patients deal with everyday challenges of schizophrenia.<br> These treatments are often most helpful after patients find a medication that works. <br><br>Treatments include:<br> <br> • Family education: teaches the whole family how to cope with the illness and help their loved one <br>
                                • Illness management skills: helps the patient learn about schizophrenia and manage it from day-to-day <br>
                                • Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): helps the patient identify current problems and how to solve them. A CBT therapist focuses on changing unhelpful patterns of thinking and behavior. <br>
                                • Rehabilitation: helps with getting a job or going to school and everyday living skills<br>
                                • Self-help groups: provide support from other people with the illness and their families<br>
                                • Treatment for drug and alcohol misuse: is often combined with other treatments for schizophrenia
